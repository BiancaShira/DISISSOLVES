🛠️ Updated Fix & Feature Prompt for DisiSolves

The system DisiSolves requires updates to correct user permissions, improve admin functionality, and simplify workflows. Below are the corrected requirements.

🔑 User Role (Fixes & Updates)

Most recent issues

All available questions

Restrictions

🔑 Admin Role (Fixes & Updates)

Post Question + Answer Together

Instead of having a separate “Raise an Issue” option, replace it with a combined form where Admins can:

Post a new issue/question.

Provide an answer to it immediately.

The posted question + answer should be visible right away without requiring approval.

No priority levels are needed.

Answer Posting (Fix)

Admins should still be able to post answers to existing questions if needed.

Sidebar Fixes

Browse All → Show all questions with answers (filter by category, search, etc.).

Analytics → Reporting station showing activity (questions by category, answers posted, user engagement, trending issues, etc.).

User Management → Fully functional (add/edit/delete users, assign roles).

🎨 UI/UX Adjustments

System must remain lightweight, responsive, and support both dark/light themes.
