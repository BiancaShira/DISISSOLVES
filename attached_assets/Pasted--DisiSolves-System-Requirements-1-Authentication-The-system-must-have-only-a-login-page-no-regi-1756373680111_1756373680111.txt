3. Questions & Answers Flow

Users:

Can raise questions/issues.

Can attach images when raising questions.

Submitted questions become immediately visible to Supervisors (no Admin approval required at this stage).

Supervisors:

Can see user questions.

Can post answers (with image attachments).

Supervisor answers stay hidden from users until approved by an Admin.

Admins:

Can raise issues with answers directly.

Can approve/reject supervisor answers.

Can delete rejected questions/answers.

Once Admin posts or approves an answer â†’ it is final (no edits, no second answers).

Both questions and answers must support image attachments.

4. UI Fixes

Submit Button:

Must be redesigned to look clear, bold, and highly visible for both posting questions and answers (especially for Admin).

Search Bar:

Must be fully functional across all roles to search questions/issues.

Analytics Dashboard:

Must be dynamic, updating in real time with:

Number of issues raised

Number of issues answered

Pending approvals

Issues by user role (Users vs Supervisors vs Admins)

5. Email Notifications

When a user raises a question/issue, send an email alert to both Admin accounts (admin, superadmin).

Email text should be:

Subject: New Issue Raised
Body: A new issue has been raised by [username]. Please log in to review.

ðŸ‘‰ This checklist prompt ensures:

All accounts are predefined with passwords.

Sidebars are role-specific and working.

Search bar + analytics are fixed.

Submit button is clear.

Image uploads work for both questions and answers.

Admins get email alerts when new issues are raised.
