he system DisiSolves has the following bugs and missing features that need to be fixed and enhanced. This prompt defines exactly how the system should behave.

🔑 General Fixes (All Accounts)

Session/Login Switching Bug (Critical)

Currently, when multiple accounts are opened in the same tab, refreshing causes the system to switch accounts (e.g., User → suddenly becomes Admin).

Fix: Each login session must stay persistent and isolated to the correct account role. No auto-switching between roles after refresh.

Sidebar Functionality (Fix)

Ensure all sidebar items work correctly for Admin, Supervisor, and User:

Dashboard

Browse All

My Activity

(For Admin only: Analytics + User Management)

🔑 Admin Role Fixes & Features

Post Question + Answer (Fix)

Currently, when Admin posts a question + answer, only the question is saved.

Fix so both question and answer are recorded together.

Final Authority Rules

When Admin posts a question + answer, it is considered final:

No other user (User/Supervisor) can add answers.

No editing of Admin-posted question/answer.

Delete Rejected Questions

Admin must be able to delete questions that were rejected (not just leave them pending).

🔑 Supervisor Role Fixes & Features

Posting Answers

Fix issue where supervisor answers get recorded as questions.

Answers must be correctly tied to a question and go to admin for approval.

Posting Questions Restriction

Supervisor can only post one question per issue.

They cannot post multiple versions of the same issue until the previous one is approved or rejected.

🔑 User Role Fixes & Features

Restrictions

Users can only:

View trending, most recent, and all questions.

Raise an issue (submit a question).

Users cannot post answers.

UI Clean-Up

Remove any unnecessary status bar or admin-only options from User dashboard.

📎 Attachments (New Feature for All Roles)

When raising or posting an issue/question, there should be an option to attach an image (screenshot/photo) if necessary.

Attachments should be stored and displayed alongside the question or answer.

🚀 Deliverables

Can post question + answer together (both saved).
