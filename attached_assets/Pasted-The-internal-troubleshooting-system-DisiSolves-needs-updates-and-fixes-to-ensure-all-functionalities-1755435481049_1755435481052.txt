The internal troubleshooting system DisiSolves needs updates and fixes to ensure all functionalities work properly across Admin, Supervisor, and User dashboards. Below are the detailed requirements, including bug fixes, missing features, and enhancements.

🔑 General Issues Across Roles

Sidebar Functionalities Not Working Properly:

Dashboard → Should display a quick summary of activity: trending questions, recent issues, and user activity stats.

Browse All → Should display all questions in the system (paginated, searchable, and filterable by software category: IBML, SoftTrac, OmniScan).

My Activity → Should display actions performed by the logged-in user (questions posted, answers posted, approvals, etc.).

These three sections must work consistently across User, Supervisor, and Admin dashboards.

🔑 Admin Role Fixes & Enhancements

Browse All (Fix)

Currently not working → Must show a list of all questions in the system with filters (by category, by status: pending/approved).

Analytics (Fix/Enhancement)

Should work as a reporting station, providing:

Number of questions raised by category (IBML, SoftTrac, OmniScan).

Number of approved vs pending questions.

Number of answers posted (approved vs pending).

Most active users and supervisors.

Trending issues (most views/answers).

User Management (Fix)

Must allow the admin to:

View all users.

Add new users (manually since no signup).

Edit or delete users.

Assign or change roles (Admin, User, Supervisor).

Answer Posting (Fix)

Admin must be able to post answers directly to any question.

Currently, Admin cannot post answers → fix this functionality.

🔑 Supervisor Role Fixes & Enhancements

Posting Answers (Fix)

Currently, when a supervisor tries to post an answer, it is saved/displayed as a question.

Fix so supervisors can correctly post answers linked to questions.

Posting Questions (Fix)

Supervisor is currently unable to post questions.

Enable supervisors to post questions (subject to admin approval).

Sidebar Functionalities (Fix)

Dashboard → Should show trending questions, recent issues, and a snapshot of supervisor’s own activity.

Browse All → Should show all questions.

My Activity → Should display supervisor’s own posted questions/answers (with status: pending/approved).

🔑 User Role Fixes & Enhancements

Sidebar Functionalities (Fix)

Dashboard → Should show trending questions, recent issues, and a quick snapshot of raised issues.

Browse All → Must list all approved questions and answers in the system.

My Activity → Should display only the user’s own raised questions.

Raise an Issue

Users must continue to be able to post questions/issues only (no answers).

Questions go directly to admin approval workflow.

🗄️ Database Adjustments (if needed)

Ensure questions and answers tables are correctly separated:

Questions Table stores raised issues.

Answers Table stores responses linked to questions (not mistakenly saved as new questions).

Add proper relationships (answers.question_id → questions.id).

🎨 UI/UX Adjustments

Sidebar buttons (Dashboard, Browse All, My Activity, Analytics, User Management) must be fully functional across all roles.

Use clear distinction between "Post Question" and "Post Answer" forms to prevent confusion.

Maintain existing color scheme:

Dark Green → #052E16

Lime Green → #84CC16

Keep support for Light Mode and Dark Mode themes.
